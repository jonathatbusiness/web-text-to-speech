# Text-to-speech web

**About**

This web text-to-speech project turns text into speech, saving the result into a mp3 file. This project uses Microsoft Azure Speech Services and javascript code to generate the voices.

As a javascript study project, I used the OpenAI ChatGPT to help me generate de javascript codes.



**Important:**

The actual project need to be configurated for correct working and you need an Microsoft Azure account to get the data needed, like a subscription key.
