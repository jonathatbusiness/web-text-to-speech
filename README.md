# Text-to-speech web

**About**

This web text-to-speech project turns text into speech, saving the result into an mp3 file. This project uses Microsoft Azure Speech Services and javascript code to generate the voices.

As a javascript study project, I used the OpenAI ChatGPT to help me generate de javascript codes.

**Important:**

The actual project needs to be configurated for correct working and you need a Microsoft Azure account to get the data needed, like a subscription key.

You can find more details here: [Cognitive Speech Services â€“ Text/Speech Analysis | Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cognitive-services/speech-services/).
